        <h1>Joe O'Meara</h1>
        
        <p>I handle Growth & Brand at Palindrom. I help companies implement AI and flourish as a result.</p>
        
        <p>I was born and raised in Amsterdam. At 10, I moved to London where I was exposed to advertising and technology at a young age. By 16, I was fascinated by human decision-making and how markets shape behavior. This led me to study Economics at the University of Bristol to understand these dynamics. After university, I didn't want to go down the traditional career route that most economics graduates take, which drew me to venture capital and the startup ecosystem, where you can create outsized impact and value early in your career. Since then, I've worked across VC funds, startups, and venture builders, and am now fortunate to be scaling Palindrom.</p>
        
        <p>In my free time, I enjoy [hobbies and interests]. I'm always learning new technologies and working on side projects.</p>
        
        <p>I'm currently working on several projects including AutoGenLib, a Python library for dynamic code generation, and various web applications.</p>
